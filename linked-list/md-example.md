# My Markdown File

This is a simple Markdown file that demonstrates some of the basic formatting features of Markdown.

## Headings

You can create headings by using the `#` symbol followed by a space and the heading text. The number of `#` symbols indicates the level of the heading. For example:

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

## Lists

You can create lists by using `-` or `*` followed by a space and the list item text. For example:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

## Links

You can create links by using `[link text](link URL)`. For example:

[Google](https://www.google.com)

## Bold and Italic Text

You can create bold or italic text by using `**` or `__` around the text for bold, or `*` or `_` around the text for italic. For example:

**bold text**
*italic text*
